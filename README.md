#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This project focuses on a **Restaurant Reviews** app, where we have been tasked to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, the static design lacked accessibility and did not have a responsive layout. Finally, the app had to be accessible for screen reader use. We were required to add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for our users.


### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. To setup a simple python server:

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
